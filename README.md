Assignment 1 - FYS-2021 Machine Learning. 

Uncomment the nessecary parts of the code to get the relevant outout/plots. Done to easily run the code for the later sections in the code. 

The plotting function plot_errors_with_lr in section 2a of the code can take several minutes to compute the plot.

Used sklearn in:
-Problem 1C: Splitting the data into test and training set with train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
-Problem 3a: -Calculating the confusion_matrix and displayig it with sklearn.metrics with confusion_matrix and ConfusionMatrixDisplay.
-Problem 3b: Showing the accuracy_score with sklearn.metrics.
